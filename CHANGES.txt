Hadoop HDFS Change Log

Trunk (unreleased changes)

    HDFS-76. Better error message to users when commands fail because of 
    lack of quota. Allow quota to be set even if the limit is lower than
    current consumption. (Boris Shkolnik via rangadi)

    HADOOP-4687. HDFS is split from Hadoop Core. It is a subproject under 
    Hadoop (Owen O'Malley)
